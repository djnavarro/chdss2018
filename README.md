# CHDSS Day 2: Data analysis with R

The goal in Day 2 is to cover topics relevant to data analysis with R. The coverage is somewhat eclectic: there are sections that discuss tools that will help you with your workflow (e.g., git, R Markdown, etc), sections that discuss how to manipulate and visualise data (e.g., tidyverse), and a section that discusses statistical modelling in R (e.g., linear models, mixed models). Given the breadth of coverage, we won't go into much detail on any topic. You should think of each section as an initial introduction to something that is itself a much larger topic.

Within each content section, I've linked to a written tutorial, the HTML version of my slides, and (TODO) a set of do-it-yourself exercises.

- Working with git and GitHub ([tutorial](tutorials/git.md), [slides](https://djnavarro.github.io/slides/git.html))
- Working with R markdown and R projects ([tutorial](tutorials/projects.md), [slides](https://djnavarro.github.io/slides/projects.html))
- Data wrangling in tidyverse ([tutorial](tutorials/wrangling.md), [slides](https://djnavarro.github.io/slides/wrangling.html))
- Data visualisation in tidyverse ([tutorial](tutorials/visualisation.md), [slides](https://djnavarro.github.io/slides/visualisation.html))
- Statistical modelling in R ([tutorial](tutorials/statistics.md), [slides](https://djnavarro.github.io/slides/statistics.html))

R packages used: `tidyverse`, `skimr`, `here`, `lme4`, `lsr`

Assumed knowledge:

- Basic R programming, as per Day 0.
- Mostly independent of Day 1.
- Undergraudat level statistics

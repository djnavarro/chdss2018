Researchers from psychology and other disciplines are increasingly relying on computational analyses of large data sets to draw conclusions about human behaviour. This kind of research
requires skills that are not often taught as part of the psychology curriculum, and the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences is therefore pleased to announce the first annual [Complex Human Data summer school](http://chdsummerschool.com/).

## Day 2

The goal in Day 2 is to cover topics relevant to data analysis with R. The coverage is somewhat eclectic: there are sections that discuss tools that will help you with your workflow (e.g., git, R Markdown, etc), sections that discuss how to manipulate and visualise data (e.g., tidyverse), and a section that discusses statistical modelling in R (e.g., linear models, mixed models). Given the breadth of coverage, we won't go into much detail on any topic. You should think of each section as an initial introduction to something that is itself a much larger topic.

Within each content section, there is a written tutorial linked to below (with varying levels of detail!) and as well as the HTML slides. 

- Working with git and GitHub: [git.html](git.html), [git-slides.html](git-slides.html)
- Working with R markdown and R projects: [projects.html](projects.html), [projects-slides.html](projects-slides.html)
- Data wrangling in tidyverse: [wrangling.html](wrangling.html), [wrangling-slides.html](wrangling-slides.html)
- Data visualisation in tidyverse: [visualisation.html](visualisation.html), [visualisation-slides.html](visualisation-slides.html)
- Statistical modelling in R: [statistics.html](statistics.html), [statistics-slides.html](statistics-slides.html)

Each section has an interactive component, but it's a little different for each section:

- For the git and projects sections, the goal will be to create your own repository and initialise an RStudio project within it. The repository that I created is the [summerschool](https://github.com/djnavarro/summerschool) repo.
- For the data wrangling section, there is a structure sequence of exercises that you can work through in parallel with the session (the slides have explicit break points
- For the data visualisation, it's freeform. The way this session will run is that I'll give a very brief lecture, and then you should feel free to explore ggplot to your hearts content!
- For the statistical modelling section ???

R packages used: `tidyverse`, `skimr`, `here`, `lme4`, `lsr`

Assumed knowledge:

- Basic R programming, as per Day 0.
- Mostly independent of Day 1.
- Undergraduate level statistics
